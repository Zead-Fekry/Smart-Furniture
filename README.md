# gradutionproject based on Augmented Reality


Problem Definition:

Some people cannot imagine what the furniture will look like in their home and they can’t move it to their house.They wonder: Is it suitable in our home?

Objectives:

1-Provide 3d models for user to try them

2-Using Augmented Reality to provide 
    a virtual view that near to be real.

3-Help user to choose suitable way to
    furnishing his house

Methodologies:


The Smart Furniture application was developed using the Flutter framework, a cross-platform tool for building high-quality mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.

To incorporate augmented reality functionality, the application utilized the AR Flutter plugin, an SDK that provides features such as motion tracking, environmental understanding, and object placement

The 3D furniture models were created using GLTF, a modeling technique that combines multiple high-resolution images to create a detailed and realistic 3D model.

GLTF models were optimized for real-time rendering and display within the application, ensuring accurate representation of textures, colors, and dimensions.
